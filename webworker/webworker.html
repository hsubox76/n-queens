      <h1>n-Queens Solution Through Web Worker Distribution</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="all-container clearfix">

        <div class="intro">The n-Queens problem is a popular math puzzle where the goal is to determine how many different configurations of
        <em>n</em> queens can be placed on an <em>n x n</em> chessboard such that none of the queens can attack each other.</div>

        <div class="intro">Calculating the solution starts to take a lot of processing power at a certain n (about 13 on my Macbook Pro).
        A good way to speed it up is to split up the processing tasks among multiple processors.  We do that here with HTML5
        web workers.  Each web worker spins off a separate process and uses a different core, if available, which makes the task more efficient as long as you don't have more web workers than cores.</div>

        <div class="intro">I think the originating process takes up a core too, so you should see improvement up until the number of
        web workers is equal to the number of cores you have minus 1.</div>
